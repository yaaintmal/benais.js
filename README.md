# üó£Ô∏è **benais.js** - Your Message's Chill Filter (Beta)

Hey there, future communication wizard! Ever hit send on a message and then instantly thought, "Oops, maybe I could've said that a *little* nicer?" Well, say hello to **benais.js**! This cool, tiny JavaScript snippet is like your message's personal chill pill. It sniffs out if your words are giving off grumpy vibes and then helps you whip 'em into a super polite, helpful, and all-around awesome message. All this magic happens with a super smart brain called a Local Large Language Model (LLM) right on your computer!

## ‚ú® Super Cool Features

* **Grumpy-o-Meter (Rudeness Detection):** **benais.js** has a superpower! It can tell if your message sounds a bit like it just woke up on the wrong side of the bed. It's like having a little friendly radar for harsh words! (actually it can't right now, but you'll see where this is getting at...)

* **Instant Nice-ification (Polite Rephrasing):** If the Grumpy-o-Meter goes off, poof! **benais.js** swoops in and suggests a kinder, gentler, and more diplomatic way to say what you mean. No more accidental sour notes!

* **Your Own Brainy Sidekick (Local LLM Integration):** The best part? **benais.js** uses a super-duper smart language model that lives right on *your* computer. That means your messages stay private, and you're the boss of how it learns and helps!

## üöÄ How **benais.js** Does Its Thing

Imagine you're sending a message. You give it to **benais.js**, and it hands it over to your super-smart **Ollama LLM** chilling on your computer. This model reads your message and thinks, "Hmm, is this giving off sunshine or storm clouds?" If it senses a storm brewing (aka, your message sounds a bit negative), it quickly drafts up a new, brighter, and friendlier version. Then, Benais.js hands that shiny new message back to you! Easy peasy, lemon squeezy!

## üíª Get Your Chill On With **benais.js**!

Wanna get **benais.js** making your messages sparkle? You'll need just two things:

1.  **Your Own Personal LLM Guru:** First up, make sure you've got a local LLM (like **Ollama**) already set up and running on your machine. Think of it as inviting your smart assistant to the party! Just make sure you know its address (the `ollamaUrl`) and which model you want it to use (like `gemma3`).

2.  **Toss **benais.js** into Your Project:** Just copy and paste this little JavaScript snippet into your code, and let the magic begin!

```javascript
// This is your **benais.js** super-chilled snippet! ‚ú®

async function makeMyMessageChill(originalMessage) {
    // Make sure this is your local Ollama server address!
    const ollamaUrl = "[http://192.168.178.6:11434/api/chat](http://192.168.178.6:11434/api/chat)"; // <-- IMPORTANT: Change this if yours is different!
    const llmModel = "gemma3"; // <-- You can change this to your favorite model!

    // This is the brainy prompt Benais.js uses to turn grumpy into gleeful!
    const prompt = `You are a helpful text filter. Analyze the following sentence and determine if it contains any negative or "bad" meaning. If it does, rewrite the sentence to have a positive, opposite meaning. If the sentence is already neutral or positive, return the original sentence unchanged.

    Example 1: "This is a terrible situation." -> "This is a wonderful situation."
    Example 2: "What an awful day!" -> "What a wonderful day!"
    Example 3: "The sky is blue today." -> "The sky is blue today."

    If the sentence does not contain any negative or "bad" meaning, return the original sentence unchanged.

    The sentence to transform is: "${originalMessage}"

    Transformed sentence:`;

    try {
        // benais.js sends your message to your local LLM!
        const response = await fetch(ollamaUrl, {
            method: "POST",
            headers: {
                "Content-Type": "application/json",
            },
            body: JSON.stringify({
                model: llmModel,
                messages: [{
                    role: "user",
                    content: prompt,
                }],
                stream: false, // We want the whole nice message at once!
            }),
        });
[...]


// getting args from the CLI right here, expecting String /tbd

const originalText = process.argv[2];
[...]
```

Just a Heads Up! Remember to update the ollamaUrl and llmModel in the code snippet to match your specific Ollama setup. You got this!

üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Running **benais.js** from your Terminal!
