🗣️ **benais.js** - Your Message's Chill Filter (Beta)

Hey there, future communication wizard! Ever hit send on a message and then instantly thought, "Oops, maybe I could've said that a little nicer?" Well, say hello to Benais.js! This cool, tiny JavaScript snippet is like your message's personal chill pill. It sniffs out if your words are giving off grumpy vibes and then helps you whip 'em into a super polite, helpful, and all-around awesome message. All this magic happens with a super smart brain called a Local Large Language Model (LLM) right on your computer!
✨ Super Cool Features:

    + Grumpy-o-Meter (Rudeness Detection): Benais.js has a superpower! It can tell if your message sounds a bit like it just woke up on the wrong side of the bed. It's like having a little friendly radar for harsh words!
    + Instant Nice-ification (Polite Rephrasing): If the Grumpy-o-Meter goes off, poof! Benais.js swoops in and suggests a kinder, gentler, and more diplomatic way to say what you mean. No more accidental sour notes!
    + Your Own Brainy Sidekick (Local LLM Integration): The best part? Benais.js uses a super-duper smart language model that lives right on your computer. That means your messages stay private, and you're the boss of how it learns and helps!

🚀 How **benais**.js Does Its Thing

Imagine you're sending a message. You give it to Benais.js, and it hands it over to the super-smart language model chilling on your computer. This model reads your message and thinks, "Hmm, is this giving off sunshine or storm clouds?" If it senses a storm brewing (aka, your message sounds a bit negative), it quickly drafts up a new, brighter, and friendlier version. Then, Benais.js hands that shiny new message back to you! Easy peasy, lemon squeezy!
